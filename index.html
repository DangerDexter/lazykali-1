<p>A refresh of LazyKali which simplifies install of tools and configuration. Original author appears missing. I have emailed him at the last known address in an attempt to verify that there is no current version of this script since 2013.</p>

<p>I'll be working through all of the menus to ensure that any options in this app are compliant with how Kali 2016.01 and beyond function. Please use caution with the first few versions, and feel free to file issues. The goal is to make this something that helps someone get a system up to speed right after install, and to have some maintenance tools as well.</p>

<p>If there are any tools in this utility that are installed by default by Kali then they might be removed unless there is good reason to keep them. No need to duplicate efforts. This tool can be both for the expert as well as the new user to have an easy way to add all the tweaks that are usually applied when you are setting up a system. </p>
